# NeoVim IDE

This repo tracks my attempt at building a new IDE setup with neovim and LSP entirely configured
with the Lua programming language.

It is still a work in progress, but already in a state that I can productively use and which lead me to replace [my previous 
setup](https://github.com/ferrao/laptop-dot-files/tree/master/e14/config/nvim)
